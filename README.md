This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when running unit tests within a Docker container. The Dockerfile uses `unittest discover`, which fails to find the test modules because of a discrepancy between the working directory within the container and the location of test files. The solution demonstrates how to correctly set the working directory and execute the tests.
